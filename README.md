# Recipe-Search-API

Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and the Edamam API, I made and hosted a website that allows a user to search for different recipes and view their details and ingredients. 

Website is hosted at [https://tastycanada.xyz](tastycanada.xyz) using Vultr. (the domain name isn't related to the website content)
